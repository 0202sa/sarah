<p><blockquote><font color="darkblue"><p>Definition: Experience refers to conscious events in general, more specifically to perceptions, or to the practical knowledge and familiarity that is produced by these processes. Understood as a conscious event in the widest sense, experience involves a subject to which various items are presented. In this sense, seeing a yellow bird on a branch presents the subject with the objects "bird" and "branch", the relation between them and the property "yellow". Unreal items may be included as well, which happens when experiencing hallucinations or dreams. When understood in a more restricted sense, only sensory consciousness counts as experience. In this sense, experience is usually identified with perception and contrasted with other types of conscious events, like thinking or imagining. In a slightly different sense, experience refers not to the conscious events themselves but to the practical knowledge and familiarity they produce. In this sense, it is important that direct perceptual contact with the external world is the source of knowledge.<img src="image/e1.jpg" style="float:left"/ align="absmiddle" hspace="40"width="30%" height="30%">So an experienced hiker is someone who actually lived through many hikes, not someone who merely read many books about hiking. This is associated both with recurrent past acquaintance and the abilities learned through them.</p><br>There are many different types of experience, but I want to discuss about work experience. I've had three separate job responsibilities. They include waiters, chefs, and promoters. I choose to be a promoter among these three categories. This is due to the fact that promoters expend a lot of energy and frequently engage with clients. There is no doubting that there are a wide variety of clients. However, in my role as a promoter, I work to generate interest by outlining my sales offerings. The benefit of being a promoter is that, even in tense or challenging settings, we can control how we speak to recognise their interests.<img src=image/promoter.jpg width="20%" height="30%" vspace="30"align="right"><br><br>Aside from that, I have worked as a food delivery person in a grocery store. Here, I realise that it's crucial to have dexterity and efficiency while also paying attention to the menu and the clientele. This is due to the fact that each store employs a unique concept, necessitating swift action and knowledge of the next move on the part of the staff. Being a waiter is not a challenging experience because the company pays for the food and beverages, which is a benefit. However, I can learn about the significance of responsibility from this employment. Regardless, the commodities utilised for clients must be delivered correctly, and the service supplied must be with services that may create an atmosphere.<br><br>In conclusion, I feel that my work experience is not that great but this taught me how to face the public. Likewise, work also matures our thinking because we experience the growth phase and begin to know the world. Luck continues to progress, we should often be exposed to the business environment or around agencies to see their life cycle and inspire us.
